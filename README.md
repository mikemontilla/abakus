# Abakus
This is a project to manage my start-up accounts. Right now there are two projects in my start-up. The first one is about an on-line store where I and my partner sell geek t-shirts with original and well designed prints. You can check it here: https://geeked.com.co. The second one is a project to find lost pets using the last technologies for communications and communities interested on contributting to the search.
